# Cancer Predictor ML

Cancer Predictor ML is a machine learning project that aims to predict the likelihood of two types of cancer: breast cancer and diabetes. The project includes two separate applications, each focusing on predicting one type of cancer. The machine learning models employed are based on Logistic Regression, achieving an impressive accuracy of over 95%. Additionally, the project features an interactive graph that responds dynamically to user input.

## Applications

### 1. Breast Cancer Predictor
- Utilizes Logistic Regression to predict the likelihood of breast cancer.
- Achieves over 97% accuracy in breast cancer predictions.
- Interactive graph visually represents the predictions based on user input.

### 2. Diabetes Predictor
- Implements Logistic Regression for predicting the likelihood of diabetes.
- Achieves over 95% accuracy in diabetes predictions.
- Interactive graph provides a dynamic visualization based on user input.
